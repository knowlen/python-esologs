### Fixed

- Type annotations now satisfy mypy without `# type: ignore` comments
- Parameter validation errors now provide more helpful context
- Fixed kwargs passthrough issue in report methods preventing HTTP client errors
- Fixed markdown formatting issues in authentication documentation

## [0.2.0a2] - 2024-07-16

### Fixed

- **CRITICAL**: Moved authentication module (`access_token.py`) into the package as `esologs.auth` so it's included in pip distributions
- Updated all imports to use `from esologs.auth import get_access_token` or `from esologs import get_access_token`
- Authentication is now properly packaged and accessible when installing from PyPI
